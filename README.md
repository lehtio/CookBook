# 🌍 International Roommate Recipes

Welcome! 👋

During my exchange, I’ve had the joy of living with **6 amazing roommates** from all around the world. One thing we all share is a love for food and cooking. 🍽️

We often cook together, host dinners, and share recipes from our home countries. This repository is a collection of those **memorable meals and beloved recipes** — a flavorful memory of our exchange house.

Whether you're here for inspiration, nostalgia, or just a good meal — enjoy!
